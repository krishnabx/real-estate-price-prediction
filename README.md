## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to take a machine learning model **all the way into a working web app**.

The system consists of:

- 🧠 **ML Model (Scikit-Learn)** trained on housing data  
- 🐍 **Flask API** to serve predictions  
- 🌐 **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)** for user input  
- 🔄 **Real-time inference** (API → UI update)  

Users can enter square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and location, and instantly receive a price estimate.
